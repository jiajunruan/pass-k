Set the environment variable HYDRA_FULL_ERROR=1 for a complete stack trace.
Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /users/2/jruan/.triton/autotune, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.
